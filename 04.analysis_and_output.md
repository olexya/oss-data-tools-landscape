# Analysis and Output Tools

Analysis and output tools are crucial components in the data analytics pipeline, enabling users to derive insights from processed data and present them in an understandable format. These tools range from programming frameworks for custom visualizations to no-code platforms for quick and easy chart creation. 

They can be broadly categorized into five main areas:
- **Framework**: Libraries available for creating visualizations
- **High-code**: Interfaces requiring substantial coding to create visualizations
- **Low-code**: Applications requiring little development but some technical skills
- **No-code**: Drag-and-drop interfaces requiring no programming skills
- **Web Analytics**: Tools for analyzing website and user behavior data

## Available Tools

Here is a summary table of the main analysis and output tools we have identified, sorted by subcategory and alphabetical order.
