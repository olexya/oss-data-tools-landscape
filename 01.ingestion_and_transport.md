# Data Ingestion and Transport Tools

Data ingestion and transport are crucial processes in the field of data management. They involve collecting, moving, and integrating data from various sources into a centralized location, typically a data warehouse or data lake. These processes are essential to ensure that data is available, up-to-date, and ready for analysis.

They can be broadly categorized into four main areas:
- **Data Replication**: Process of copying and synchronizing data between different systems or locations. It maintains consistent data copies across multiple servers or sites, improving availability, reliability, and performance of dependent applications.
- **Event/Stream Processing**: Handles real-time data flows as events occur, enabling continuous capture, processing, and analysis of data streams. Ideal for scenarios requiring immediate insights and real-time analytics, supporting high-throughput processing of live data.
- **Log Collection and Processing**: Gathers, aggregates, and analyzes log data from various systems and applications. Provides capabilities for log parsing, filtering, and routing, essential for system monitoring, troubleshooting, and security analysis.
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Identifies and captures data changes at the source, transferring them to targets in real-time or near real-time. Enables efficient data replication and synchronization without full data transfers.
